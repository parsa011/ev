DONE : 
1 - get and convert key to string, for example convert control + a to C-a or alt + c to M-c
    also compatible for combine, like  C-M-a
2 - Combine to key, for exable : "A C-b" means first A then Control b
3 - open file into editor, also editor should be able to open multiple buffers

IN PROGRESS :
4 - check if editor needs to update buffer or no (render it again)
	because every time render is waste of time
5 - convert buffer col to char offset, if we move to another line, current char is not current (for char_offset)
