DONE : 
1 - get and convert key to string, for example convert control + a to C-a or alt + c to M-c
    also compatible for combine, like  C-M-a
2 - Combine to key, for exable : "A C-b" means first A then Control b
3 - open file into editor, also editor should be able to open multiple buffers
4 - check if editor needs to update buffer or no (render it again)
	because every time render is waste of time
5 - convert buffer col to char offset, if we move to another line, current char is not current (for char_offset)
6 - remove line, also remove line when pressing backspace key in empty line
7 - Go to first and last line of buffer
8 - kill next word
9 - showing prompt and showing messages
10 - kill buffer
11 - implement emacs M-u (upcase-word) and M-l (downcase-word) commands

IN PROGRESS :
    - more functionalities to prompt bar, like M-f, M-b, M-d, M-u, M-l 

TODO : 
    - indent line
    - yank and paste
    - undo
